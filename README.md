# number-lines
this is a tool to number lines for every 10 words. this program was made by natrine who cannot code so Lol.

how to use
1. turn your journal entry into a .txt file
2. remove or replace non-ascii characters in your txt file (ctrl + h or whatever you use to replace) with ascii characters (ex. turning ” into ", ’ into ') because the commands i use don't recognize some of them
3. put this program into the same folder as that txt file (recommended)
4. open up your favorite text editor (notepad, sublime text, vs code, etc.) to change this program for your txt file
5. save your changes
6. run number-lines.py (by double-clicking it in your file explorer, for example)

### what YOU have to change to use this program:
the filename

### what YOU can change, but don't have to, to use this program:
the dataStripping command and the dataOriginal command

if you want to make this program better, make a fork of this then change whatever you want Lol.
